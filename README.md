# MERGER_MODELS_MENON_2024
Post-merger models at C-dep, from Menon et al. 2024
These are all models from the table of Menon et al. 2024 (ApJ Letters), that are evolved until Carbon depletion. They have rotation, mass loss and an additional mixing prescription during the merger to mimic the consequences of the inspiralling and shredding of the secondary in the envelope of the primary. The stars merge before or during core He-burning in the primary star.

Every binary considered should have 2 profile.data files:

2 C-dep models: In the format 'M1_M2_Msun_fc_value.data', where M1 = ZAMS mass of primary, M2 = ZAMS mass of secondary, fc = fraction of He-core dredged up during the merging = 0 or >0
