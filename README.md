# MERGER_MODELS_MENON_2024
Post-merger models at C-dep, from Menon et al. 2024
These are all models from the table of Menon et al. 2024 (ApJ Letters), that are evolved until Carbon depletion. They have rotation, mass loss and an additional mixing prescription during the merger to mimic the consequences of the inspiralling and shredding of the secondary in the envelope of the primary. The stars merge before or during core He-burning in the primary star.

Filename format: M1_M2_fc_value, where M1 = mass of primary, M2 = mass of secondary, fc = fraction of the He core that is dredged up during the merging.
